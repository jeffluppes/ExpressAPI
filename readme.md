#Introduction
Basic RESTful Express API for GeoJSON. Work in progress. Meant for establishing good practises with MongoDB.

#Installation
1. Run `npm install` in the folder where you've placed these files. This ought to prompt npm to install the dependencies.
2. Run `node server.js` in your command prompt to get the API up and running. It should tell you which port it's on.

###Notes
- Remember to restart after changing code by ctrl+C and running `node server.js` again, or using a tool like nodemon.
- You might have to release the port if something goes wrong. Failing that, just change the port number as defined in `server.js`.
- Test with cURL or Postman. :-)
